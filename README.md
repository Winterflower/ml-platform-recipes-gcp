# ML Platform Recipes for GCP 

Three years ago, I entered slightly uncharted territories when I started a new job where my task was to build out an ML Platform. 
Coming from a mostly scienc-y/data scienc-y background, I was in for a rude awakening about how much I didn't even know I didn't know. 

So here is a collection of some opinionated things I learned about building ML Platforms on GCP. 

As always, many of these are context-specific, so take these learnings with a grain of your own organizational salt
and apply what's useful. 

Happy platforming!
